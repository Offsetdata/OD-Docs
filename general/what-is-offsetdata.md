# What is Offsetdata

## What is Offsetdata?

### Introduction

Offsetdata is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that specializes in verifiable data marketplace powered by blockchain that connects data buyers to sellers for easy monetisation. Our platform offers a seamless integration process, allowing users to submit data via API, Chrome extension, or NPM package. This documentation aims to provide an overview of Offsetdata's core features and functionality.

### How Offsetdata Works

1. Data Submission: Users can submit their data to Offsetdata using various methods such as our API, Chrome extension, or NPM package. The data is securely transmitted to our backend infrastructure.
2. Encryption and Hashing: Upon receiving the data, Offsetdata's backend encrypts the data to ensure its confidentiality. Additionally, we apply a hashing algorithm to generate a unique hash value for the data.
3. Storage on the Blockchain: The generated hash is then stored on a public blockchain using the Offsetdata smart contract. This process ensures the immutability and transparency of the data.
4. Original Data Storage: Offsetdata also retains a copy of the original data in our secure database. This enables users to validate their data at a later stage by comparing it with the stored hash and the original data.
5. Data Validation: Users have the ability to validate their data using Offsetdata's validation feature. By comparing the stored hash on the blockchain with the original data, users can ensure data integrity and verify its authenticity.
6. GDPR Compliance: Offsetdata is fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If users require their data to be edited or removed, Offsetdata can delete the original record from our database. Once deleted, the stored original hash becomes impossible to decrypt and read.

### Benefits of Offsetdata

1. Data Security: By leveraging blockchain technology, Offsetdata provides enhanced security for data storage and ensures its integrity.
2. Data Validation: Users can easily validate their data against the stored hash and original data, providing a robust verification mechanism.
3. Transparency: The use of a public blockchain ensures transparency and trust in the data stored by Offsetdata.
4. GDPR Compliance: Offsetdata's adherence to GDPR regulations ensures user privacy and control over their data.
5. Seamless Integration: Offsetdata offers multiple submission methods, making it easy for companies to integrate their existing systems with our platform.

### In Short

Offsetdata offers a secure and efficient solution for Web2 and Web3 companies looking to store their data on the blockchain. By leveraging encryption, hashing, and smart contracts, we provide data integrity, transparency, and verification capabilities. With GDPR compliance and seamless integration options, Offsetdata is a trusted partner for companies aiming to enhance the security and reliability of their data storage.
