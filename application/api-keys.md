# API Keys

API keys are essential for accessing our API and ensuring the security and stability of your applications. By following a few simple steps on our platform, you can generate unique API keys tailored to your needs.

### API Keys

#### Generating API Keys

To generate API keys, please follow these steps:

1. Log in to your account on our [platform](https://app.offsetdata.com/).&#x20;
2. Navigate to the [API Keys ](https://app.offsetdata.com/apikeys)section.
3. Click on the "Generate new key" button.

You can generate up to 10 API keys to suit your requirements.

#### Customizing API Keys

We understand the importance of easy identification and organization. That's why we allow you to customize your API keys with descriptive names. By assigning meaningful names, you can easily identify each key and reflect the purpose of your Web3 project.

#### Key Security and Revocation

It is crucial to maintain the security of your API keys. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Do not share your API keys**: We strongly recommend that you do not display your keys to anyone. Sharing your keys can compromise the security of your applications and may result in unexpected billing.
* **Revoke keys when necessary**: You have full control over your API keys and can revoke them at any time. If you suspect unauthorized access or need to restrict access for any reason, you can revoke a key to disable it immediately.

### Status of API Keys

When viewing the list of your API keys, you will see the following information:

* **Active key**: Active keys are displayed in green and indicate that they are currently active and can be used to access our API.
* **Revoked (inactive) key**: Revoked keys are displayed in red and indicate that they are no longer active. These keys have been disabled and cannot be used to access our API.

### In Short

API keys are a fundamental aspect of accessing Offsetdata's API securely. By following the guidelines outlined in this documentation, you can generate, customize, and manage your API keys effectively. Remember to keep your keys secure and use them only for their intended purposes to prevent misuse.
