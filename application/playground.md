# Playground

The Offsetdata Playground Page is a powerful tool designed to experiment with various functions related to NFT metadata and Mapping.

## NFT Metadata Display (Demo)

The NFT Metadata Display feature allows you to explore and interact with the metadata associated with a specific NFT asset.

To get started, you need to provide the token address and token ID of the asset you're interested in. This information is essential to access the original metadata associated with the asset.

### Getting Started

• To begin, locate the "Enter token Address and ID" section on the playground page.

• In the "tokenAddress" field, enter the token address of the NFT asset you want to explore.

• In the "tokenId" field, enter the token ID corresponding to the specific asset you wish to investigate.

## Exploring Metadata

Once you have provided the token address and token ID, you can begin exploring the metadata associated with the asset.

The metadata provides essential information about the asset, such as its name, description, image URL, and other attributes. This allows you to gain insights into the asset's characteristics and attributes.

## Modifying Metadata

In some cases, the original metadata associated with an asset may not be structured in a way that suits your requirements. To address this, the Offsetdata Playground Page allows you to modify the metadata, enabling you to add or remove certain properties to enhance its usability or better represent the asset such as 2D, 3D representation.

When modifying the metadata, it's crucial to consider the potential impact on how the asset is perceived and used by others in the ecosystem.

Ensure that any changes align with your specific needs and adhere to the relevant standards and guidelines.

## Additional Layers of Metadata

The NFT ecosystem can utilize multiple layers of metadata to provide additional context and information about an asset.

The Offsetdata Playground Page enables you to explore these higher layers of metadata and discover new attributes and fields that offer valuable insights into the asset and its usability.

## NFT Mapping

The mapping feature in the Offsetdata Playground Page allows you to perform mapping operations on NFT collections.

To begin mapping tokens within a collection, follow the steps outlined below:

• Locate the "Enter collection address and tokens to map" section on the playground page.

• In the "collectionAddress" field, enter the address of the NFT collection you want to map tokens from.

• In the "from" field, specify the starting token ID of the range you wish to map. In the "to" field, indicate the ending token ID of the range you want to map.

## Mapping Tokens

Once you have provided the collection address and the range of tokens you wish to map, you can proceed with the mapping operation. The mapping functionality allows you to remap the tokens within the specified range to a new range of token IDs.

For example, if you have a collection with tokens ranging from 1 to 10 and you want to map them to a new range starting from 1001, you would enter the collection address and specify the "from" field as 1 and the "to" field as 10. Additionally, you would enter the desired starting token ID of the new range in the "to" field, which in this case would be 1001.

Please note that mapping tokens does not modify the underlying NFT assets themselves; it only reassigns the token IDs within the specified range. The original assets and their associated metadata remain intact.
